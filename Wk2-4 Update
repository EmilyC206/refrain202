To summarize the general updates:

I am halfway through Summer Quarter 2025, but the primary work thus far is my personal website. I've actually chosen a completely different direction from making it about photography.
Original publii code and html5 boilerplate being geared towards a picture blog means I've got some reworking to do.

I’m focusing on developing a custom font in CSS for the class website. CSS profile is definetly a new skill I have picked up as well as Git for website version control. For my personal website, I’m backfilling issues as I go, documenting work I did previously on HTML and CSS. Currently, I have two blog posts posted and a CSS profile featuring 431 elements. I’ve learned that nesting tables is especially challenging in class, but it's kinda given.

For the personal project rework, I plan to use a kanban board for class website issues as well. Since I’m already agile certified, I feel comfortable managing said feature request on the board.
