Today, it is  amassive annual convention with thousands of attendees, including nerds like myself. I would describe the core of DEFCON to be a community space; a space for people curious about technology to come together. <br><br>Everybody there was keen to share knowledge, demonstrate vulnerabilities, and push the boundaries of computing and security. For myself, I volunteered in the embedded systems villages dedicated to hardware hacking, pcb design, wireless security, and even social engineering as a whole.</p>\n<p>I had a great time taking part in this tradition. That I had a chance to blends serious security research with CTFs and \"Cultural exchange\". So remember, our goal is to celebrate openness, curiosity, and self improvments. I'm very glad to be a part of hacker history.</p>",

A SQL Database!<br><br>SQL databases make my job much smoother by keeping all business information together in a relational stucture.

Many medical businesses contract their IT out to a SaaS product or MSp. By making my own database with a front-end for staff, I am let make it possible for entry level employees to learn how to enter orders or update inventory without knowing technical SQL commands.<br><br>It's amazing what you can do with technology.</p>\n</div>",
